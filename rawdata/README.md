# Raw Data Directory #

This directory will house the raw simulation data exported from MongoDB.  

I am not including them in this Github repository because with the configuration file
in the conf/ subdirectory, the exported "postclassification" CSV file is 1.5GB.  

The steps for recreating this database are found in the main README file for this repository.  

Other files included in this directory are the column headers for various stages in processing
including the raw data files.  They are useful for putting onto the various data blobs 
in preparation for import to R, or for building additional Pig scripts for processing.
